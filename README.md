This is my fork of [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), a 
federated social network. It's [hosted on Heroku](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/running-mastodon-on-heroku/)
at [mastodon.technology](https://mastodon.technology), paid for in part by [my 
lovely Patreon sponsors](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3581610).

The `deploy` branch's Rails server is automatically deployed to Heroku, and the 
`streaming` branch's NodeJS server is automatically deployed as a seperate app.

I've decided to adopt the [TootCat Code of Conduct](https://github.com/TootCat/mastodon/wiki/Code-of-Conduct/41432d2c42ba9be52f2710b8b5c7b77f41271c0b).
Reports are dealt with regularly.

We block the [instances listed here](https://github.com/tootcafe/blocked-instances)
for the reasons stated there. [Contact me](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com) if you 
think your instance is blocked incorrectly.
